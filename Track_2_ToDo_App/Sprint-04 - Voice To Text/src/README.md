# Sprint 4 - Source Code Directory
This directory contains the completed source code after the end of each user story.    The directory is structured as `app-s04-f01-us01` where
- `s04` - represents the sprint number, in this case sprint 4
- `f01` - represents the feature number, in this case feature 1
- `us01` - represents the user story number, in this case user story 1

> [!NOTE]
> The code in the directory is the completed solution after the completion of that user story.  Like many other things in life, there are many ways to solve a problem.   The source code in these directories is just one solution to the problem and does not necessarily represent best practices for a given solution.  In many cases we chose simplicity or readability over efficiency.
